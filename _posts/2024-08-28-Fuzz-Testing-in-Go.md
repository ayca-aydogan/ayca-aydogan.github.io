## Fuzz Testing in Go

In this article, I’ll cover the basics of fuzz testing and how to perform it with the built-in tools in Golang. This is actually the written in english version of the presentation I gave at Gophers Ankara in 2023 as well as GoConf Istanbul in February 2024. 

If you’re interested, you can watch the full presentation from Istanbul GoConf via [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ4SX9UxicM). 

You can download the presentation from [here](https://github.com/ayca-aydogan/ayca-aydogan.github.io/blob/main/_posts/attachments/2024-08-28-Fuzz-Testing-in-Go/Fuzz.pdf?raw=true).

You can find the code in demo [here](https://github.com/ayca-aydogan/FuzzTestDemo) to try it yourself.
